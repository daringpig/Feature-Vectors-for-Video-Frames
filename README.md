# Feature-Vectors-for-Video-Frames
Dealing with videos for classification can be difficult as there's both features across space as well as across time. Using a CNN based feature extractor would extract the spacial features and let an RNN/ LSTM take care of the temporal features. This repo contains code to extract the spatial features using pretrained networks.
